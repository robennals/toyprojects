# HEIC to JPEG

This folder contains a simple script `convert.py` that converts all HEIC/HEIF images in a directory to JPEG files.
The original HEIC files are removed after conversion so that only JPEG images remain.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python convert.py /path/to/folder
```
