# Photo Link

This folder contains a small script `update.py` that updates a yearbook CSV file to reference photos generated by the `photorename` project.

The script scans a directory of named photos (e.g. `Alice-1.jpeg`) and sets the `photo` column in the CSV to the matching file name for each row based on the `name` column.

## Usage

```bash
pip install pandas
python update.py data.csv /path/to/photo_dir -o updated.csv
```
